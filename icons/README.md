# Icons

Place your extension icons in this folder with the following sizes:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

You can create icons using:
- Online tools like [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) or [icon-generator.org](https://www.icon-generator.org/)
- Image editing software (Photoshop, GIMP, etc.)
- Vector graphics tools (Illustrator, Inkscape) - export as PNG

For now, you can temporarily use any PNG images renamed to match the required filenames. The extension will work, but you'll see errors in the console until proper icons are added.
